Below are some ideas and improvements you could consider for a “quick momentum‐capture” approach in the first few minutes of the XINA50’s open. These suggestions have both a strategic (trading logic) dimension and a coding dimension. Obviously, short‐term scalping is risky, and none of this is formal financial advice—just some ways you might refine or expand on what you already have.

1) Implement an Opening‐Range or “Pop” Breakout Strategy
Conceptual overview
Opening‐range breakout: You define a short time window (e.g., the first 1–5 minutes) after the market opens and measure the high and low. If price breaks above the high (or below the low), that’s an indication to buy (or sell) and go for a quick scalp (e.g., 10‐point target).

Gap‐and‐go or “Pop” setups: If the first bar(s) have abnormally high volume and a strong price surge, you assume it might continue in that direction briefly and trade with a tight stop and small profit target.

Programming ideas
Record the first N bars (e.g. up to the 5‐minute mark).

Establish the “opening range”:

python
Copy
opening_high = max(bar['high'] for bar in first_N_bars)
opening_low = min(bar['low'] for bar in first_N_bars)
Trigger once price exceeds opening_high or breaks below opening_low.

Scalping: Immediately place a target order for +10 points and a protective stop.

You can integrate this logic into your existing bar finalization. Perhaps once you see that the bar close is above the opening range by some threshold, you fire off the trade logic.

2) Continue/Refine Your 15‐Second “Surge Detector”
You already have a surge detector that checks if the close of the new bar has moved by more than SURGE_THRESHOLD from the previous bar’s close. Some refinements:

Use Volume Filters

If a big price bar comes with big volume, treat it as more meaningful than a similar price move on low volume.

You could incorporate a “volume surge” threshold as well. For example, if volume in the current 15s bar is >200% of the average volume of the last 10 bars, that’s a big sign of momentum.

Use Consecutive Surges

Instead of taking every single bar that meets a threshold, watch for a pattern of two or three consecutive upward (or downward) surges. That reduces false starts if you only get a single spike.

Time‐of‐Day Check

If your main edge is right at market open, restrict the surge detection to (say) the first 15 minutes of the session. That way you’re focusing on the time you believe momentum trades are more likely to work.

Immediate Orders vs. Next Bar Orders

Right now, you appear to finalize a bar, detect the surge, then do something. Consider whether you might want to place your order on the “next tick” or “next bar open,” or even market‐in immediately if you detect the surge. Speed often matters in scalping.

3) Hard‐Code a 10‐Point Scalping Target with Stop
Once you see a surge, your logic might do the following in pseudo‐code:

python
Copy
if surge_up_detected:
    # Enter a long position
    buy_order_price = current_price  # or current ask
    target_price = buy_order_price + 10
    stop_price = buy_order_price - (some protective distance)
    place_bracket_order(
        action="BUY",
        entry=buy_order_price,
        target=target_price,
        stop=stop_price
    )
And the reverse for a downward surge. That way your risk is well‐defined, and you’re aiming for a tight 10‐point scalp.

4) “Kill Switch” or Time‐Based Exit
Scalping strategies often rely on very short holding times. If the trade hasn’t hit your 10‐point target within, say, 1–2 minutes, you might want to auto‐exit to avoid churn or reversal.

This can be done by storing the timestamp of your entry trade and, in your “pending tickers” or bar finalization routine, checking if X seconds have elapsed. If you’re still in the position, flatten.

5) Improve Code Clarity and Modularity
Right now, your on_pending_tickers function handles streaming ticks, updates the bar, and does surge detection. A few suggestions to keep your code more maintainable and easier to extend:

Break out bar‐building code into a separate function, e.g. def update_bar_data(tick, bar_data) -> updated_bar_data.

Break out surge detection into its own function, e.g. def detect_surge(new_bar, old_bar, threshold) -> bool or +1/–1 for direction.

Break out trade logic from the “signal generation.” In your main function, once you detect a “surge up,” you call place_surge_trade(...).

This structure will make it easier to add or tweak logic (like a volume filter, or consecutive surge logic) without cluttering your main event callback.

6) Use a More Sensitive Data Feed (If Possible)
You’re currently waiting every 15 seconds (BAR_INTERVAL = 15) to finalize a bar and check for a surge. The first few minutes of open can move quickly. You might prefer a shorter bar interval (5s or even 1s), or you could perform your surge detection on the incoming ticks themselves (i.e., tick‐by‐tick) rather than waiting for a bar to close.

This obviously depends on whether your broker/data provider allows for tick‐by‐tick or 1s bars. But if you really want those first‐minute scalps, a 15s bar might sometimes be late.

7) Logging and Debugging
You’ve already got nice logging in place. Just be sure you’re thoroughly logging:

Your recognized signals (e.g., “Detected Surge Up at …,” “Placing order now at …”).

The outcome of each trade (did it reach +10 points? did the stop trigger? how many seconds in the trade?).

Good logs let you quickly evaluate if the strategy is actually capturing the open’s momentum or if slippage and false signals are eating up the gains.

Summing It Up
Opening‐Range or “Pop” Breakout – Quickly identify the day’s initial high/low in the first 1–5 minutes, then trade the breakout if it aligns with volume/momentum.

Refine Surge Detection – Filter by volume, consecutive surges, or only trade in a specific time window.

Bracket Your Trades – Hard‐code a 10‐point profit target and a protective stop so you’re not left guessing.

Time‐Based Exits – If your scalp doesn’t work quickly, get out quickly.

Refactor the Code – Keep your bar updates, surge detection, and trade logic in separate functions for maintainability.

Faster Data = Faster Scalping – If 15s bars are too slow, consider 5s or tick‐based detection.

With these improvements, you’ll have a more structured, robust approach to capturing that frantic first‐few‐minutes momentum in the XINA50 contract. Good luck, and remember to manage your risk carefully!
